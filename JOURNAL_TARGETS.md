# Target Journals for Publication

## Primary Targets (Best Fit)

### 1. **Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality (JPC)**
- **Publisher**: Open access
- **Focus**: Methods and applications of privacy-preserving data analysis
- **Why good fit**: 
  - Specializes in differential privacy research
  - Values practical implementations
  - Open to software announcements with methodological contributions
- **Impact**: Leading venue for privacy research
- **Typical timeline**: 3-6 months
- **Submission format**: LaTeX preferred, 20-30 pages

### 2. **Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) - Machine Learning Open Source Software Track**
- **Publisher**: Open access
- **Focus**: Open source ML software with research contributions
- **Why good fit**:
  - Explicit track for software papers
  - Values reproducibility and practical impact
  - DP-SGD bridges ML and statistics
- **Impact Factor**: ~6.0
- **Typical timeline**: 4-6 months
- **Submission format**: JMLR LaTeX style, 4-8 pages

### 3. **Journal of Statistical Software (JSS)**
- **Publisher**: Open access
- **Focus**: Statistical software and algorithms
- **Why good fit**:
  - Explicitly for statistical software packages
  - Values practical implementations
  - Familiar to statsmodels users
- **Impact Factor**: ~3.5
- **Typical timeline**: 6-12 months
- **Submission format**: JSS LaTeX style, includes code

## Secondary Targets (Good Alternatives)

### 4. **Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PoPETs)**
- **Publisher**: De Gruyter Open
- **Focus**: Privacy-enhancing technologies
- **Why consider**: Strong privacy focus, quarterly deadlines
- **Impact**: Top venue for privacy tech
- **Format**: 4 issues/year, 20 pages

### 5. **Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics (JCGS)**
- **Publisher**: ASA/Taylor & Francis
- **Focus**: Computational statistics methods
- **Why consider**: Values statistical computing innovations
- **Impact Factor**: ~2.4
- **Note**: May need to emphasize statistical aspects over privacy

### 6. **Computational Statistics & Data Analysis (CSDA)**
- **Publisher**: Elsevier
- **Focus**: Computational statistics and data analysis methods
- **Why consider**: Broad readership in applied statistics
- **Impact Factor**: ~2.0
- **Note**: Less open access friendly

## Specialized Venues

### 7. **PriML Workshop at NeurIPS**
- **Focus**: Privacy in machine learning
- **Format**: 4-page workshop paper
- **Why consider**: Quick publication, good feedback

### 8. **Theory and Practice of Differential Privacy (TPDP)**
- **Focus**: Annual workshop on DP
- **Format**: Extended abstract or full paper
- **Why consider**: Highly targeted audience

## Recommended Strategy

### Primary Submission: **Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality**
**Rationale**:
1. Perfect topical fit - they explicitly seek DP implementations
2. Open access aligns with PolicyEngine values
3. Audience will immediately appreciate the contribution
4. Editors familiar with the standard error problem

### Backup Plan:
1. If JPC desk rejects or requests major theory: → **JMLR MLOSS Track**
2. If need quicker publication: → **PoPETs** (quarterly deadlines)
3. If want broader statistical audience: → **JSS**

### Parallel Strategy:
- Submit short version to **TPDP workshop** for early feedback
- Full version to **JPC** for archival publication
